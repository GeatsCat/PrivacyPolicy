                        these agreement. If you do not agree to these Terms then please do not access, or use our
                        Services.</strong><br>This is the agreement between you and us for our services you download or
                    access, whether that’s a game, something that supports the game, or something else. You can only use
                    these things once you agree to these terms. You are now reading our End User License Agreement
                    (“EULA”) which is a legal agreement between you and EC Game (“we”, “us”, “our”, as appropriate)
                    regarding the Services you use from us. The “Services” mean collectively, and sometimes
                    individually, the following: (a) each of our Games, and (b) any websites, software, or other
                    services we provide with or in support of the Game, whether they are installed or used on a
                    computer, console, or a mobile device. “Game” means any game developed and/or made available by us,
                    whether existing now or in the future.<br>We’ve tried to be straightforward in this EULA, and if you
                    have any questions feel free to send us a note at developer_team@topjoy.com&nbsp;(our “Support Email
                    Address”).</span></li>
            <li><span style="margin-left:3.00em"><strong>Defined Terms</strong><br>You’ll notice some capitalized terms
                    in this EULA. They’re called “defined terms,” and we use them so we don’t have to repeat the same
                    language again and again, and to make sure that the use of these terms is consistent throughout the
                    EULA. We’ve included the defined terms throughout because we want it to be easy for you to read them
                    in context.</span></li>
            <li><span style="margin-left:3.00em"><strong>Additional Terms</strong><br>Some Services may be available (or
                    only available) through accessing (or downloading from) a third-party platform or store, including
                    but not limited to, Steam game platform, the Google Play Store and Apple App Store (each, an
                    “<strong>App Store</strong>”). Your use of the Services is also governed by any applicable
                    agreements you have with any App Store (the “<strong>App Store Agreement(s)</strong>”). In the event
                    of a conflict between any other App Store Agreement(s) from which you acquire one of our Games and
                    this EULA with respect to your use of the Services, this EULA will take priority.<br>The collection
                    of information from you and related to the Services (whether obtained through an App Store or not)
                    is governed by our Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose
                    information that we collect from and about you.</span></li>
            <li><span style="margin-left:3.00em"><strong>Eligibility and Registration</strong><br>The Services we offer
                    have certain age restrictions. Others may require an outside account. When you give us information,
                    you need to make sure it stays up to date. Also, don’t share your account with others without our
                    permission.<br><strong>1）Age.</strong>&nbsp;To create a Game Account (as defined below) and access
                    some of our Services, you must be at least the minimum age for consenting to personal data
                    collection under the law in your jurisdiction. If you are between the minimum age for personal data
                    collection and age of majority in your jurisdiction, your parent or guardian must review this EULA
                    and accept it on your behalf. Parents and guardians are responsible for the acts of their children
                    when using our Services.<br>We may allow a minor under the minimum age for personal data collection
                    to register for certain Services with the verified consent of a parent or legal guardian. The
                    parent/legal guardian may be asked to provide additional documentation or perform additional actions
                    as part of the verification and approval process as consistent with applicable law. We recommend
                    that parents and guardians familiarize themselves with parental controls on the devices they provide
                    their child.<br><strong>2）Account Creation.</strong>&nbsp;To access parts of a Game, you may need to
                    create an in-game account (your “Game Account”). Your Game Account, if applicable, is separate from
                    any account you may have with any App Store (your “App Store Account”). You may be able to create
                    your Game Account using an existing account you have with us or your email address. To the extent
                    you create your Game Account using a third-party account, we may access certain personal information
                    that this third party provides to us such as your email address and name to help create your Game
                    Account. Further information about use of third-party accounts is provided in the Privacy Policy.
                    Please note that you may also be able to play the Game without creating a Game Account, but you may
                    not be able to access certain parts of the Game, and your Game data may be deleted if you uninstall
                    or otherwise delete the Game.<br><strong>3）Keep Your Information Current.</strong>&nbsp;It’s
                    important that you provide us with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information for your Game
                    Account, and you agree to update such information to keep it that way. If you don’t, we may suspend
                    or terminate your Game Account. You agree that you will not disclose your Game Account password to
                    anyone, and will notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Game Account. You are
                    responsible for all activities that occur under your Game Account, whether you know about them. If
                    you believe that your Game Account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at our
                    Support Email Address.<br><strong>4） No Account Sharing.</strong>&nbsp;You may not sell, resell,
                    rent, lease, share or provide access to your Game Account to anyone else. We reserve all available
                    legal rights and remedies to prevent unauthorized use of our Services, including, but not limited
                    to, technological barriers, IP mapping, and, in serious cases, directly contacting your Internet
                    Service Provider (ISP) regarding such unauthorized use.<br><strong>5) No False
                        Accounts.</strong>&nbsp;You may not create a Game Account for anyone else or create a Game
                    Account in a name other than your own.</span></li>
            <li><span style="margin-left:3.00em"><strong>License and Use of the Services</strong><br>If you agree to
                    this EULA, we grant you permission to access and use our Services. If you break the rules or can’t
                    agree, we can’t let you play. Please ensure your system and devices meet the minimum requirements
